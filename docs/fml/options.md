# Options

An _option_ is one typed scalar the camera knows about - a setting, slider, or
enum. Options are defined in [`fml/option.cue`](../../fml/option.cue) and
referenced everywhere else by id.

```cue
options: <id>: #Option & {
    spec:     <Spec>
    codegen?: <Codegen>
}
```

`<id>` is a stable identifier. It's a `snake_case` Rust ident; CUE guarantees
uniqueness across the map. The id is what `ref` fields point at throughout the
schema.

## Kinds

Every option declares a `kind`. The four kinds drive both validation and the
kind of Rust type that gets emitted.

| `kind`    | Logical type | Generated Rust shape                       |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `integer` | `i32`        | newtype `struct Name(i16/u16)` _or_ `enum` |
| `float`   | `f32`        | newtype `struct Name(i16)` _or_ `enum`     |
| `string`  | `String`     | newtype `struct Name(String)`              |
| `enum`    | named symbol | `#[repr(u16/i16)] enum`                    |

Which of the two shapes a numeric option gets depends on its `encoding`:

- `raw` / `scale` -> newtype struct (logical value is dense within the range).
- `lookup` -> enum (logical value is one of a finite set).

## Rules

`rules` constrain the logical (user-facing) value. They drive parsing, range
checks, the bounds the generated `MIN`/`MAX`/`STEP` consts expose, and the
schema-derived details shown by leaf-command `--help`.

```cue
// integer
rules: {min?: int, max?: int, step?: int}

// float
rules: {min?: float, max?: float, step?: float}

// string
rules: {min_length?: uint, max_length?: uint}

// enum
rules: {variants: [...{id, name, aliases: [...]}]}
```

`variants[*].id` is what `ref` predicates name. `variants[*].name` is the
human-readable label (`Display`). `variants[*].aliases` is the list of strings
accepted at parse time, in addition to the id and the name, so a user can type
`--white-balance auto`, `--white-balance Auto`, or `--white-balance temp` (and
get the closest-match suggestion if they typo).

Parsing normalizes the input and every key the same way: trim, lowercase, and
keep only ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `-`, and `+`. `PRO Neg. Hi` therefore
matches `proneg.hi`, and `HDR800+` stays distinct from `HDR800`. Because the
name is always a key, `Display` output round-trips through `FromStr`, which is
what `simulation export` and `simulation import` rely on; the generator emits a
test per enum that checks exactly that.

Enum ids and variant aliases must be unique across the variants; a `_validation`
block enforces this at export time. The generator additionally fails the build
when two variants of one option accept the same normalized input, since the
first match arm would otherwise win silently.

## Encoding

`encoding` tells the codegen how to translate the logical value to and from the
camera's wire representation. It has its own `kind`:

| `encoding.kind` | What it means                                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `raw`           | Wire value equals logical value.                         |
| `scale`         | Wire value = logical * `spec.scale`. Integer or float.   |
| `lookup`        | Explicit map from logical key (string) to wire value(s). |

Every encoding may carry an optional `prop_code: uint16`. Present means the
option is a top-level PTP device property (readable / writable via
`GetDevicePropValue` / `SetDevicePropValue`); absent means the option is only
used as a positional slot inside a render profile.

### `raw`

```cue
encoding: {kind: "raw", prop_code?: uint16}
```

Used for strings and for numeric options whose logical and wire representations
coincide.

### `scale`

```cue
encoding: {kind: "scale", prop_code?: uint16, spec: {scale: int}}
```

The wire value is `logical * scale`. Used when the camera uses fixed- point
storage for nominally fractional values (`highlight_tone`'s `scale: 10` means
`1.5` rides the wire as `15`).

### `lookup`

```cue
encoding: {
    kind: "lookup"
    prop_code?: uint16
    spec: values: {
        "<logical-key>": int | [int, ...int]   // single canonical or canonical+alternates
    }
}
```

- For `enum` kinds, the keys must be exactly the variant ids; `close({...})` in
  CUE enforces this.
- For `integer` lookup, keys must parse as integers; for `float` lookup, as
  floats. Codegen generates `Plus`/`Minus`/`Zero`-prefixed variants (`Plus4`,
  `Minus0_3`, `Zero`).
- Values are either a single wire int or a list. The first element is the
  canonical wire value (used when serializing); the rest are alternates accepted
  at deserialization (older firmwares, undocumented spellings).

This global lookup is the generation/model default, not sufficient authority
for a camera write. Camera firmware profiles narrow allowed logical values and
may replace canonical/read wire values. A validated session pins the exact
profile; simulation and RAW conversion codecs consult it for both directions.
For a wire-value list, writes use the first value and reads accept every listed
alias.

Wire values must collectively fit in either `i16` or `u16`. Codegen picks `i16`
if any value is negative, `u16` otherwise, and bails if the range spans both
(e.g. `[-1, 40000]`).

## `codegen` Block

Optional knobs for the codegen, not part of the runtime semantics:

```cue
codegen: {
    skip_args?: true  // do not expose as a --<id> CLI flag
}
```

`skip_args` is used for options like `custom_setting` or `usb_mode` that are
managed by `fujicli` itself, not by the user. The option still has a generated
type and `SimulationSetting` impl; it just doesn't appear on `SimulationArgs` /
`RenderArgs`.

## What Gets Generated

For every option, codegen emits a self-contained module of impls. Roughly:

| Impl                                        | Always?            | Notes                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `Debug, Clone, Copy/Eq, PartialEq`          | Yes                | `Copy` everywhere except strings.     |
| `Display`                                   | Yes                | Friendly form (variant name / value). |
| `FromStr`                                   | Yes                | Validates rules, accepts aliases.     |
| `Serialize / Deserialize`                   | Yes                | JSON-friendly.                        |
| `TryFrom<i32>` / `TryFrom<f32>`             | Numeric            | Range + step check.                   |
| `From<Self> for i32` / `From<Self> for f32` | Numeric            | Lossless reverse.                     |
| `binrw::BinRead, binrw::BinWrite`           | Yes                | PTP wire codec.                       |
| `SimulationSetting` (carries `prop_code()`) | If `prop_code` set | Used by `try_pull` / `try_push`.      |
| `ConversionProfileField`                    | Yes                | 32-bit lifted codec for render slots. |

The unifying constraint: numeric scaled options always use `i16`/`u16` on the
wire (Fuji's convention) and `i32` logical / `i32` profile-slot. The `signed`
determination is made from the rules' min or the lookup values' range.
