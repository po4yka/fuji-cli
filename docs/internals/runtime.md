# Runtime

The runtime is the small Rust crate that mounts the `src/lib/generated/` module
and dispatches user requests through trait objects. There is deliberately not
much here; the heavy lifting is at build time.

## The Trait Hierarchy

`CameraBase` is the root. Every camera struct implements it; feature
participation is signalled by overriding `as_<feature>_*` methods that default
to `None`.

```rust
pub trait CameraBase {
    type Context: rusb::UsbContext;

    fn camera_definition(&self) -> &'static SupportedCamera;
    fn chunk_size(&self) -> usize { 1024 * 1024 }

    fn as_backup_manager(&self) -> Option<&dyn CameraBackupManager<...>> { None }
    fn as_simulation_parser(&self) -> Option<&dyn CameraSimulationParser> { None }
    fn as_simulation_manager(&self) -> Option<&dyn CameraSimulationManager<...>> { None }
    fn as_render_manager(&self) -> Option<&dyn CameraRenderManager<...>> { None }

    fn get_info(&self, ptp: &mut Ptp) -> anyhow::Result<Box<dyn CameraInfo>> { ... }
}
```

The codegen emits overrides only for the features the camera spec declares:

```rust
// src/lib/generated/cameras.rs (sketch)
impl CameraBase for XT5 {
    type Context = rusb::GlobalContext;
    fn camera_definition(&self) -> &'static SupportedCamera { &C_X_T5 }
    fn chunk_size(&self) -> usize { 16128 * 1024 }

    fn as_backup_manager(&self) -> Option<&dyn CameraBackupManager<...>> { Some(self) }
    fn as_simulation_parser(&self)  -> Option<&dyn CameraSimulationParser>  { Some(self) }
    fn as_simulation_manager(&self) -> Option<&dyn CameraSimulationManager<...>> { Some(self) }
    fn as_render_manager(&self)     -> Option<&dyn CameraRenderManager<...>>     { Some(self) }
}
```

If a camera doesn't declare a feature, the override is omitted, the default
`None` is returned, and the runtime's high-level method errors with a friendly
message.

## Top-Level Dispatch

[`src/lib/mod.rs`](../../src/lib/mod.rs) wraps the trait dispatch:

```rust
impl Camera {
    pub fn export_backup(&mut self) -> anyhow::Result<Vec<u8>> {
        if let Some(backups) = self.r#impl.as_backup_manager() {
            backups.export_backup(&mut self.ptp)
        } else {
            bail!(ERROR_CAMERA_DOES_NOT_SUPPORT_BACKUP_MANAGEMENT);
        }
    }
    // similar for simulations, render, ...
}
```

The CLI doesn't see the per-camera types at all; it always goes through
`Camera`. Adding a new camera to the schema automatically extends the dispatch
surface; nothing in `src/cli/` needs to know.

## Feature Traits

### `CameraBackupManager`

[`features/backup/manager.rs`](../../src/lib/features/backup/manager.rs)
provides default implementations of `export_backup` and `import_backup` against
`Ptp`; the underlying PTP exchange has been uniform across the cameras we've
seen, so this is a blanket
`impl<T> CameraBackupManager for T where T: CameraBase`. A camera opts in by
overriding `as_backup_manager` to return `Some(self)`.

### `CameraSimulationParser` + `Simulation`

[`features/simulation/`](../../src/lib/features/simulation/).
`CameraSimulationParser` is JSON serialize/deserialize (so users can round-trip
a slot to disk). `Simulation` is the trait object the parser yields: `try_pull`,
`try_push`, `try_update_from`, `name`, `to_base`. Codegen implements both for
every simulation-capable camera.

`SimulationListItem` is a small helper struct used by `simulation
list`.

### `CameraSimulationManager`

The PTP-talking interface: `custom_settings_slots`, `get_simulation`,
`update_simulation`, `set_simulation`. The codegen-emitted impl uses the
option's `SimulationSetting::try_push` to select the slot before
reading/writing.

### `CameraRenderManager`

[`features/render/manager.rs`](../../src/lib/features/render/manager.rs)
provides default `send_image` / `render_image` (uniform across cameras). Each
render-capable camera must override `render`, which the codegen does: send the
image, fetch the current `<Camera>RenderProfile`, `try_update_from(partial)`,
write back, then `render_image`.

Render-object polling has a five-minute absolute deadline. Each
`GetObjectHandles` exchange uses that same deadline instead of starting a fresh
five-minute transaction budget, so an empty object list or a peer that only
makes partial progress cannot keep the CLI alive past the polling deadline.

For the cross-state semantics that `try_update_from` enables, see
[fml/rules / cross-state rules](../fml/rules.md#cross-state-rules).

## PTP and Option Traits

[`src/lib/ptp/option.rs`](../../src/lib/ptp/option.rs) declares the two
option-level traits the codegen targets:

- **`SimulationSetting`**: for options with a `prop_code`. Carries
  `prop_code() -> u16` plus `try_push` / `try_pull` defaulting to
  `Ptp::set_prop` / `get_prop`.
- **`ConversionProfileField`**: for every option (including inline-only ones).
  Reads/writes the 32-bit lifted form used inside render profiles.

The PTP wire boundary lives in
[`src/lib/ptp/codec.rs`](../../src/lib/ptp/codec.rs). `binrw` owns primitive,
struct, and enum mechanics; the local module retains PTP UTF-16 strings,
u32-counted arrays, their allocation limit, and exact-buffer validation.

Every PTP transaction uses one absolute deadline across all of its bulk reads
and writes, capped at five minutes and shortened when its caller has an earlier
deadline. The per-transfer USB timeout is capped at ten seconds or the remaining
transaction time. A transport failure, malformed container, or
transaction/operation mismatch poisons the session because the stream position
is then ambiguous. Further commands fail without USB I/O, and `Camera::drop`
skips `CloseSession`. A fully framed non-OK PTP response does not poison the
session and the next transaction may proceed.

## Input Helpers

[`src/lib/input/`](../../src/lib/input/) provides:

- **`CleanAlphanumeric`**: strips whitespace/punctuation and lower-cases a
  string. Used at the start of every option's `FromStr` so variations all
  collide into the same key.
- **`Choices`**: Levenshtein-based closest-match suggestions used in `FromStr`
  error messages.

## Adding a Runtime Feature

If you want `fujicli` to support a brand-new feature (not just adding a camera
to an existing one):

1. Add the data model to `fml/camera.cue` under `#Features`.
2. Add the AST in `crates/codegen/src/ast/cameras.rs` (mirror the structure of
   `Simulation` / `Render`).
3. Add a feature trait in `src/lib/features/<name>/`, with sensible default
   impls if possible, like `CameraBackupManager`.
4. Add `as_<name>(&self)` to `CameraBase`.
5. Add an emitter in `crates/codegen/src/common/<name>/`.
6. Wire dispatch through `Camera` in `src/lib/mod.rs`.
7. If the feature has CLI surface, generate `<Feature>Args` in
   `crates/codegen/src/cli/<name>.rs` and consume it from the appropriate
   `src/cli/` module.

The grammar / DNF / presence / repair machinery is feature-agnostic and can be
reused if your feature has its own typed setting list and validation rules.
